		<div class="description">What I learned</div>
			
<div>In this stage I learned quite a bit of 
			information. I learned how the tree structure of HTML is broken down. This included the 5 element tags (Div,h1,p,a, span and text) I also learned that Font weight can control the boldness of a word <strong>Like this</strong> I also learned the box model. The box model contains 4 components (Content on the inside, then the padding, then the border and finally the margin. I also learned how to link the style.css sheet to my website using the code: link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css". This allowed me to make any edits to the font color. As you can see I was able to make this portion of my document show a red outline around the website boxes. We also went into detail on the different header sizes. Using H1, H2, and H3. H1 is the largest font header, you can see I used this for my title "Kaitlin Daily" above. Here is a sample of an h2 title As you can see this is slightly smaller than the first header.</div>

		   <div class="description">Images</div>
		  
		   	<span>I also learned how to link an image to my HTML code. This honestly took me a very long time, but I managed to figure it out with trial and error. The image must be stored in a simple file, with the exact file folders noted in the code such as this: school/images/app.png. And finally I learned the most important takeaway. Code, test, and refine. I am contantly re-looking at my code to see where I went wrong, and why I chose that code. This helps me to understand all of this better.</span>
			
			<div class="description">Benefits of Not Repeating Code</div>
			<span>I want to further discuss the benefits of not repeating codes. Repeating codes can throw the html structure into a downward spiral. Remember computers are stupid. You have to be extremely specific before you start adding in a multitude of coding. Think before you add the code in. Ask yourself, why am I adding this in here, what will the end result be?To avoid code repetition there are a few ways this can be acieved. One way to avoid this can be by using class names to style related elements. Another way can be to use the "inherit" code to assist you. The reason why code repetition happens is because if you dont feel like writing a code, and rather you would prefer to copy and paste the code in, you may be duplicating the efforts here.</span>
			
				<div class="description">Why Structured Code is so important</div>
				<span>
					A structured code is so important because it gives tells your website "here is what the website is going to look like." Having an HTML opener and an HTML closer for example tells the website that this code will be written in HTML format. Using codes such as "h1" or h2 tells the website what sizings the font will be displayed in. Finally, adding Div tags in. This tells the website that there is a divide within the paragraphs. The code structure gives the website the body, and the CSS code helps to design it.</span>
